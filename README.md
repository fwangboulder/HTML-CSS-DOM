        four parts can be changed:
        add viewport, use relative widths so that things stretch to fit across any widths
        make sure touch targets are easy to hidden-print
        test the result (using different device or change the size of the dispaly)

       Modifications:
       a. add viewport in index.html

       <meta type='viewport' content='width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0'
